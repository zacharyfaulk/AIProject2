Project Description
•	Background
o	A Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is an NP-complete problem.  A salesman is given a list of cities and a cost to travel between each pair of cities (or a list of city locations). The salesman must select a starting city and visit each city exactly one time and return to the starting city. His problem is to find the route (also known as a Hamiltonian Cycle) that will have the lowest cost. 
For this lab we are looking at a special case of TSP in which not all cities are connected and the salesperson only needs to find the best path to a target city not visit all cities.

•	Problem
o	For the given dataset (11PointDFSBFS.tsp), starting at the first city (city 1) find the shortest path to the goal city (city 11). 
o	Implement Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms
o	Visit cities in numerical order if you need to break a tie. You can hardcode connected edges into your algorithm for this problem, see table below

Solved by finding the **shortest distance** from node 1 to 11 with BFS and DFS.
